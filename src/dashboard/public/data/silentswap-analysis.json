  "findings": [
    "3 wallets identified that BOTH sent to AND received from SilentSwap",
    "These round-trip users have their privacy compromised",
    "Cross-chain routing prevents timing+amount correlation",
    "84.2% of inputs remain unlinked"
  ],
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "MEDIUM: 3 wallets exposed via round-trip usage (same wallet sends AND receives)",
    "HIGH: Low timing entropy (0%). Swap completion times are predictable.",
    "MEDIUM: 100% of multi-output swaps have unique split patterns.",
    "MEDIUM: Cross-chain timing is observable. Solana input → Solana output timing can be tracked even through Secret Network.",
    "CRITICAL: 3 of 3 matches have >70% confidence. Privacy is severely compromised."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Use separate wallets for sending and receiving to avoid round-trip exposure.",
    "Randomize processing times to make correlation harder.",
    "Avoid splitting outputs to multiple wallets, or use standard split ratios (50/50, 33/33/34).",
    "Hold funds in Secret Network for variable periods (hours to days) before output."
